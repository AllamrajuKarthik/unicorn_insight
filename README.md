# Unicorn Insights

Unicorn Insights is a data-driven exploration into India's startup ecosystem, focusing on **Unicorns** — privately held startups valued at over $1 billion. This project helps decode trends by sector, funding, and geography using both Python-based data analysis and Power BI for rich, interactive visualizations.

## Project Overview

This project enables users to:
- Select an **industry** (like Fintech, AI, EdTech, etc.)
- Automatically extract data related to that domain
- Display key insights: funding, valuation, investor count, and startup count
- Visualize results with an **interactive Power BI dashboard**

The insights are tailored dynamically for each industry — giving users a targeted perspective instead of a one-size-fits-all summary.

## 📊 Dashboard Integration

A Power BI dashboard has been integrated to visualize key insights, including:
- Number of unicorns in the selected industry
- Total funding raised
- Combined valuation
- Number of major investors
The dashboard is designed with a clean, professional layout and updates based on the selected industry data.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python** (data processing and logic)
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)
- **Power BI** (dashboard visualizations)
- **GitHub** (version control)
- **VS Code** (IDE)

## 🧠 What You Can Learn From This Project

- Building domain-specific data pipelines
- Extract-transform-load (ETL) for real-world startup data
- Using Power BI for business storytelling
- Structuring modular Python code for reusability

## 📦 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repo:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/unicorn-insights.git
   cd unicorn-insights
Run the Python program:

bash:
python unicorn_insights.py
Follow the prompt to select an industry (e.g., Fintech, AI, EdTech).

The program will generate a CSV output file. You can then use the file to create Power BI visuals of your own.

Future Plans:

1. Dockerize the project for easy execution on any system

2. Build a combined industry overview dashboard comparing all industries side-by-side

3. Add CLI improvements and possibly a basic GUI interface

4. Automate data refresh from APIs and instead of using Power BI, use Matplotlib library to generate more dynamic graphs and insights everytime we run the program with the new data we have.

🤝 Acknowledgements
This project was developed as a portfolio project to showcase real-world readiness in handling business data, building end-to-end pipelines, and visualizing actionable insights. It is part of my larger cloud-native solution architecture journey. I used Power BI just to demonstrate that we can build a power BI dashbord using the CSV file generated by the program. In the long term I plan to use matplotlib library to generate the graphs and insights.
